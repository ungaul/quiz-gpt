# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 2025/05/24**

## Introduction

This extension ("the Extension") is designed to detect and auto-answer quiz questions on web pages using the OpenAI API. We value your privacy and are committed to ensuring transparency in how data is handled.

## Data Collection and Usage

* **OpenAI API Key**: The Extension requires the user to provide an OpenAI API key. This key is stored **only** locally in the user’s browser storage.
* **User Preferences**: Settings such as typing speed or selected model (e.g., GPT-4o) are also stored locally.
* **No Page Content Storage**: While the Extension reads visible form elements (e.g., textboxes, radios, checkboxes) to extract questions, none of this content is transmitted or stored externally, beyond the call to OpenAI’s API.

## Why We Collect This Data

1. **Quiz Processing**: The Extension extracts question content from the page and sends it to the OpenAI API to generate responses.
2. **User Experience**: API keys and preferences are saved locally to avoid repeated input and maintain consistent behavior.

## Data Retention

* The API key and preferences persist only in the user’s local browser storage and can be removed at any time by uninstalling the Extension or clearing extension data.
* No information is sent to or stored on external servers controlled by the Extension developer.

## Security

* All logic runs locally in your browser environment.
* Communication with the OpenAI API is encrypted and handled directly by the browser.
* We do **not** track, log, or transmit any quiz answers, API keys, or personal data to third parties.

## Your Consent

By using the Extension, you consent to this privacy policy and the collection and use of data as described above. If you disagree with any part, please discontinue use and remove the Extension.

## Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with a new "Last Updated" date.

## Contact

For questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store listing or issue tracker.
